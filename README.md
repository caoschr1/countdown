# Countdown

Countdown is a HTML CSS and JS website that displays the time from now to a future specific date divided in days, hours, minutes and seconds. 

## Installation

Once you've downloaded the <a href = "https://github.com/caoschr1/countdown/releases/">latest release</a> just double click on index.html file. 

Actually the website is fetching data from a pockethost's backend server so you can't add your personal timers in it. 

You can build yours using their platform or readapt the code for your personal use. 

## Roadmap

In the future this website probably is going to change and becoming a platform opensource. I'm going to develop it soon. Stay tuned!
